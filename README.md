# Personnel-allocation-model-for-smelting-plant

In a small-scale organization, managing the workforce and work orders might be relatively straightforward, with clear knowledge of cost implications. However, as the organization grows, the task of tracking work orders and overseeing the workforce becomes increasingly challenging.

We encountered a specific issue related to scheduling irregular maintenance activities. To address this, we devised a model integrating linear programming principles aimed at enhancing the management of maintenance personnel assigned to irregular tasks while minimizing unscheduled hours to achieve an optimal strategy.

The dataset and model inspiration was taken by the following study:
